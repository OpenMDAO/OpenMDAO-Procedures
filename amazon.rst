Building OpenMDAO-ready Machines on Amazon EC2
===============================================

Building OpenMDAO-ready machines on Amazon EC2 can be daunting.  Here is a checklist to make the
process a little bit less difficult.

* **Log in to Amazon Web Services under the openmdao account.**
  
  Enter your own username and password.  If you don't HAVE a username or password, contact Keith or
  Justin to make an account for you.  If you don't have a copy of ``lovejoykey.pem``, get one from
  a team member or download it from the EC2 site.

* **Start an instance**

  1. From the **EC2 Dashboard-->Instances**, click the **Launch Instance** button.

  2. When the **Request Instances Wizard** comes up, choose the **Quick Start** tab to get to 
     Amazon-approved Windows AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).  Choose the Windows version that suits you. 
     (For Linux,  look in `Community AMIs` for something other than SUSE; we use Ubuntu.)

  3. Choose the instance type.  

     For 64-bit OS, choose Large (``m1.large``).  

     For 32-bit OS, choose High-CPU Medium (``c1.medium``).

  4. On the next page of **Instance Details**, leave everything at the default setting except:
     "check the box to  enable Termination Protection."

  5. Next, give the machine a name that will help you identify it (using OS, architecture, etc.)

  6. On the next page, choose **lovejoykey** from the existing key pairs.

  7. On the next page, choose **Windows security group** if you're standing up a Windows box;
     otherwise, choose the default group.

  8. Review your settings and click **LAUNCH**. Now the VM you've created will be up and running, and you
     can configure it for OpenMDAO.


**WINDOWS**

* Follow the instructions above to create an instance. 

* Then establish a **Remote Desktop Connection** into it.  

  You cannot SSH into the instance because Windows has no SSH by default. On EC2 there's a step to
  get a password for the Windows instance before you can connect. So you'll have to do that. The
  user name will be **Administrator**. Once you're in, do the following.

* Get Chrome, the Google browser.  

  You'll notice that EC2 Windows installs are RIDICULOUSLY locked down and that Internet Explorer is so lousy
  with lockdowns that you'll want to hit somebody.  Get Chrome here: 
  
      http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html

* Download and install Cygwin installer:  

      http://www.cygwin.com/install.html
    
  Make sure that while installing Cygwin you search the installables. Mark for installation:
  
  -  vi  (and any other editors)
  -  OpenSSH
  

* Install Python 2.7 installer:

  -  Download from here: 
  
     http://python.org/download/
  	
  -  Adjust the path:
  
     add ``C:\PythonXX\`` to PATH by going to **Control Panels** and editing **Env. Variables**

* Create unprivileged user:

  -  Create a user other than Administrator (for testing purposes)
  
     http://www.trainsignal.com/blog/windows-server-2008-active-directory-users
  
  -  Add new user to Cygwin:
  
     http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2003-02/msg01119.html

* SSH setup:

     http://www.eburcat.com/2009/05/sshing-into-a-windows-server-on-amazons-ec2/
  
  Setting up SSH on Windows, especially EC2, can be frustrating. And you can have it just right, 
  but the image may not work anyway when restarted. So you need to follow these 
  instructions.

  -  Git:
      
     You need Git. How else are you going to ``git OpenMDAO``? 
      
     http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?can=3&q=official+Git


  -  gcc and gfortran:

     You're going to need compilers, namely mingw32 (for Fortran and C++). You can find mingw32 here:  
      
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files  
      
     You must do the following when installing it: 
      
     1. Check the C++ compiler installation option to get g++ (required to run OpenMDAO).
      
     2. Create a file in the Administrator home directory called ``pydistutils.cfg`` that contains
	the following line: 
	   
	::
	   
	  [build_ext] compiler=mingw32 
	 
     3. Make sure to put the ``bin`` directory of the mingw32 install in your PATH.

  -  numpy:
      
     Download the installer that corresponds to your Python version and run it.
      
      
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/

  -  scipy:
      
     Download the installer that corresponds to your Python version and run it.
      
      
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/

  -  matplotlib:
	  
     Download the installer and run it.
      
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.1.0/

If you did a test install of OpenMDAO, get rid of any ``.openmdao`` dir. Make sure that neither
account's home directory contains a ``.openmdao`` directory.

**LINUX**

On Linux, things are much easier. At the very start, you'll launch an instance of a machine.  Once
that instance is launched and configured properly (after you follow the below instructions), then you'll save an image of that machine. From
then on out, you'll be able to spawn a bunch of instances from that one machine image.

*  So to start, simply choose the appropriate Linux distribution (Ubuntu Meerkat or Narwhal, in our
   case); the architecture (32- or 64-bit); and go.  
   
*  Once the instance is up and running, select its checkbox and choose **connect** from the options
   menu to get the address.

   Connecting from the command line is much simpler because SSH is already up and running on these
   machines.  The `superuser` name on these machines is **ubuntu**.  Simply type the following  (in
   a place where you can see the ``lovejoykey.pem``):

   ::

     ssh -i lovejoykey.pem ubuntu@<instance name with dashed numbers>.compute-1.amazonaws.com

*  Once you have SSHed into the machine, do the following:

   ::

     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install git
     sudo apt-get install gcc
     sudo apt-get install gfortran
     sudo apt-get install python-numpy
     sudo apt-get install python-scipy
     sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
     sudo apt-get install python-dev
     sudo apt-get install python-markdown (to fulfill a requirement for EC2 images)
     sudo apt-get install testresources (this is due to a false dependency report)
     sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer 
     sudo apt-get install google-chrome


*  ``.openmdao`` dir:

   Once you've gotten everything configured and you've run OpenMDAO on the machine, make sure that you delete the root account's ``.openmdao`` directory.

*  Making an AMI image from an instance is the next and final step.  

   An AMI is a machine image from which many instances can be spawned.  Machine images can be public
   or private, but they are private by default.  

   -  In the Instances screen, check the box next to the desired image, then choose
      **Make Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**.  

   -  Be sure to give the image a descriptive name using the format ``<Platform>_<architecture>_<python version>_OpenMDAO`` for example: ``Windows2008_64bit_py27_OpenMDAO``.  

   -  After waiting a bit, you'll finally have an image from which you can spawn multiple instances. 
      Good luck.
